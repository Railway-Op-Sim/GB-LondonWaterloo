# London Waterloo

This project covers London Waterloo station as far as Vauxhall. It is designed to connect to the Clapham Junction route, however, the timetable is not connected.

## Simulation

The included timetable runs from about 0550 to about 0750. After 0750, the services will stop arriving, however, you can still choose to route the next departures in the station.

Despite the busyness of the station, it is possible to run the simulation at 2 or 4 times normal speed. It is a good idea to consider the arrival/departure times from Waterloo as this may affect which services need routing first.

The timetabled platform can be found in brackets on arriving services. These are only a guide, so feel free to use different platforms. On departing services, you must route the service to the correct line out of the station.

## Development

This project, alongside many others, is open for development on the ROS GitHub Organisation. It can be found [here](https://github.com/Railway-Op-Sim/UK-LondonWaterloo).

If you would like to contribute, feel free to get in touch on the ROS Discord server. And we can help you out.
